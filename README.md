# One Piece API

A chapter has information

the cover resume
the short summary
the long summary

the important is how interact with the tags

the concept of references
summary has references -> to (alias) -> goes to a tag

rename alias to reference

A reference belongs to an "entity" being a character or event or important

we have aliases, an alias is a reference to a tag

a tag is a link to another wiki page

a section will use an alias to a tag, so the relations

is that each section of the chapter will reference an alias
and indirectly to a tag


the api has create endpoints and it will reference to the relations


The main important thing is what I want to answer with this application.

The alias of a reference is somthing to add


Can't think the main go or how will use it

The main idea was to get stats, but not sure how will work or what answers I wat to respond

From conversation the goal was make queries base on characters

The idea was with the bot.

Better I want a bot that scrools for new chapters in different sites and gives the chapter when is release

The bot for chapter information, just need the bot to query directly the wiki, or the wiki downloaded html


OK

La idea es buscar por una entidad y obtener las relaciones y referencias
