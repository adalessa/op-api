# One Piece API

A chapter has information

the cover resume
the short summary
the long summary

the important is how interact with the tags

the concept of references
summary has references -> to (alias) -> goes to a tag

rename alias to reference

A reference belongs to an "entity" being a character or event or important

we have aliases, an alias is a reference to a tag

a tag is a link to another wiki page

a section will use an alias to a tag, so the relations

is that each section of the chapter will reference an alias
and indirectly to a tag


the api has create endpoints and it will reference to the relations
